🎯 Just Launched: My Number Guessing Game!


Excited to share one of my latest projects – a fun and interactive Number Guessing Game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!

You can play it live here 👉 guessinggame81.ccbp.tech

🔢 How it works:
The game picks a random secret number between 1 and 100, and your challenge is to guess it! After each guess, you get instant feedback — whether your number is too high, too low, or spot on. The game also tracks your score and encourages you to beat your high score!

💡 Skills Applied:
👉 DOM Manipulation
👉 Conditional Logic
👉 Responsive UI with CSS
👉 Event Handling in JavaScript





🔁 Looking forward to your thoughts, suggestions, and ideas to improve it!
